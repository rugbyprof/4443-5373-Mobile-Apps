## User Location

Adding a map to react, and showing your current location isn't that hard. This assignment will have you show a map centered on your current location (obtained from your phone), with a dot to emphasize where you are exactly. 


 We'll include a map with a dot for the user's current location, and a "Share Location" feature. For simplicity and ease of integration, we'll use Expo's managed workflow (if you're not using Expo, the approach will be slightly different, particularly around permissions and map integration).

### Step 1: Set Up

First, ensure your project environment is ready for adding location and map features. If you're using Expo, which is great for educational purposes and quick prototyping, you'll have an easier time setting up these features.

- **Expo Installation**: If you haven't already, install the Expo CLI and initialize your project with Expo for quick setup of location and maps.
- **Install Dependencies**: You'll need to install the Expo Location and Maps packages. Run the following commands in your project directory:
  ```bash
  expo install expo-location
  expo install react-native-maps
  ```

### Step 2: Fetching and Displaying User Location

To fetch the user's location and request permissions, you can use the Expo Location API. Hereâ€™s a simplified example to get you started:

```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet, Button, TextInput } from 'react-native';
import * as Location from 'expo-location';
import MapView, { Marker } from 'react-native-maps';

const LocationScreen = () => {
  const [location, setLocation] = useState(null);
  const [errorMsg, setErrorMsg] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    (async () => {
      let { status } = await Location.requestForegroundPermissionsAsync();
      if (status !== 'granted') {
        setErrorMsg('Permission to access location was denied');
        return;
      }

      let currentLocation = await Location.getCurrentPositionAsync({});
      setLocation(currentLocation);
    })();
  }, []);

  let text = 'Waiting..';
  if (errorMsg) {
    text = errorMsg;
  } else if (location) {
    text = JSON.stringify(location);
  }

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      {location ? (
        <MapView
          style={styles.map}
          initialRegion={{
            latitude: location.coords.latitude,
            longitude: location.coords.longitude,
            latitudeDelta: 0.0922,
            longitudeDelta: 0.0421,
          }}
        >
          <Marker
            coordinate={{
              latitude: location.coords.latitude,
              longitude: location.coords.longitude,
            }}
            title="Your Location"
          />
        </MapView>
      ) : (
        <Text>{text}</Text>
      )}
      {/* Add Share Location Button and Text Input here */}
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  map: {
    width: '100%',
    height: '100%',
  },
});

export default LocationScreen;
```

### Step 3: Implementing "Share Location" Feature

For the "Share Location" feature, you'll need a button and a text input for the username. You mentioned creating an API route to send the current location, which is a great idea. Here's a simplified UI addition:

```jsx
// Add these to the LocationScreen component
const [username, setUsername] = useState('');

const shareLocation = async () => {
  if (location && username) {
    // Implement the API call to your backend to share the location
    // This will include the location data and the username
    console.log('Sharing location with:', username, 'Location:', location);
    // You might use fetch or axios to post this data to your server
  }
};

// Include in your return statement, inside the View component:
<TextInput
  placeholder="Enter friend's username"
  value={username}
  onChangeText={setUsername}
  style={styles.input}
/>
<Button title="Share Location" onPress={shareLocation} />
```

And add a style for the TextInput:
```jsx
input: {
  height: 40,
  margin: 12,
  borderWidth: 1,
  padding: 10,
},
```

### Additional Simple Feature Ideas:

1. **Real-time Location Updates**: Instead of just fetching the location once, you could use the `watchPositionAsync` method from the Expo Location API to update the user's location in real-time on the map.

2. **Displaying Shared Locations**: If you're going to implement location sharing, consider also implementing a feature to display the shared locations of friends on the map with different marker colors or labels.

This setup gives you a basic but functional location tracking and sharing feature within your React Native app. It's a

 solid foundation that introduces several key concepts in mobile development, such as working with permissions, real-time data, API integration, and basic UI elements. Let me know if there's any more detail or other features you'd like to explore!


## Icons

https://reactnativeelements.com/docs/1.2.0/icon

 Material Icons offer a variety of icons that you can use for representing location-related functionalities in your app. Here are some commonly used Material Icons for location purposes:

1. **`location_on`**: A classic marker icon, perfect for indicating a specific location on a map.
2. **`my_location`**: Ideal for a button that centers the map on the user's current location.
3. **`place`**: Similar to `location_on`, often used to represent places or interests on a map.
4. **`location_searching`**: Indicates that the location is currently being determined, useful for a loading state.
5. **`location_disabled`**: Shows that location access is turned off or permissions are not granted.
6. **`map`**: Useful for toggling map views or indicating map functionality.
7. **`directions`**: Can be used for navigation or to start directions to a particular location.
8. **`explore`**: Suggests discovery, useful for finding places of interest or exploring the map.
9. **`gps_fixed`**: Indicates that the GPS is locked on and tracking is active.
10. **`gps_not_fixed`**: Shows that the GPS signal is being searched for but not yet locked on.
11. **`gps_off`**: Indicates that GPS or location services are disabled.

These icons can be integrated into your React Native project using the `@expo/vector-icons` package, which is included with Expo, or by using the React Native Vector Icons package if you're not using Expo. Here's an example of how you might include a location icon in your app using `@expo/vector-icons`:

```jsx
import { MaterialIcons } from '@expo/vector-icons';

// In your component's render method or functional component return statement
<MaterialIcons name="location_on" size={24} color="black" />
```

Choose the icon that best fits your UI design and the action it's intended for. Material Icons are versatile and visually coherent, making them a great choice for maintaining a consistent look and feel in your app.

## Modal Form

Switching to a modal for sharing the location is a great way to keep your UI clean and focused, while still offering a powerful feature set. Let's outline how you can implement a modal for sharing the location in your React Native app.

For simplicity, we'll use React Native's built-in `Modal` component, along with state hooks to manage the modal's visibility and the username input.

### Step 1: Import the Necessary Components

First, ensure you have imported the `Modal`, `TextInput`, and `Button` components from React Native, along with the useState hook for managing state.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { Modal, View, Text, Button, TextInput, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
```

### Step 2: Define the State and Modal UI

In your component, you'll need to define some state variables to control the visibility of the modal and store the username input.

```jsx
const [modalVisible, setModalVisible] = useState(false);
const [username, setUsername] = useState('');
```

Next, define the modal's UI. This modal will contain a text input for the username and a button to submit the shared location.

```jsx
<Modal
  animationType="slide"
  transparent={true}
  visible={modalVisible}
  onRequestClose={() => {
    setModalVisible(!modalVisible);
  }}
>
  <View style={styles.centeredView}>
    <View style={styles.modalView}>
      <TextInput
        style={styles.modalText}
        placeholder="Enter friend's username"
        value={username}
        onChangeText={setUsername}
      />
      <Button
        title="Submit"
        onPress={() => {
          // Here, you'd implement the function to share the location
          // For simplicity, we're just closing the modal
          console.log('Location shared with:', username);
          setModalVisible(!modalVisible);
          setUsername(''); // Resetting username input for next use
        }}
      />
    </View>
  </View>
</Modal>
```

### Step 3: Add the 'Share Location' Button

Include a button on your main screen to open the modal.

```jsx
<Button title="Share Location" onPress={() => setModalVisible(true)} />
```

### Step 4: Styling the Modal

Finally, add some styles to make your modal look good and ensure it's centered on the screen.

```jsx
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  centeredView: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
    marginTop: 22,
  },
  modalView: {
    margin: 20,
    backgroundColor: 'white',
    borderRadius: 20,
    padding: 35,
    alignItems: 'center',
    shadowColor: '#000',
    shadowOffset: {
      width: 0,
      height: 2,
    },
    shadowOpacity: 0.25,
    shadowRadius: 4,
    elevation: 5,
  },
  modalText: {
    marginBottom: 15,
    textAlign: 'center',
  },
});
```

With this setup, you now have a clean, intuitive way for users to share their location. They press the "Share Location" button, which brings up a modal for them to enter a friend's username and submit. This approach keeps the main UI uncluttered and makes the feature feel more deliberate and focused. Remember to handle permissions and user feedback appropriately, ensuring a smooth and friendly user experience.

## GPS Functionality

Absolutely, Terry! GPS functionality opens up a world of possibilities for mobile apps, making them interactive and more useful in real-world scenarios. It's not just about tracking or mapping; it's about creating a deeper connection between the user and the physical world through technology. Here are a few cool aspects and ideas that highlight the potential of GPS in apps:
