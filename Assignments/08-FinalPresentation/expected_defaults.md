## Standard Behaviors in Apps

Here's a streamlined list of standard behaviors for mobile apps. This is a broad list topic wise, but I kept all of them here just for info. The ones that matter, include the functionality within your app.

### 1. **Form Submission Feedback**
   - **Immediate Confirmation**: Provide immediate feedback upon form submission, such as a confirmation message, a visual indicator (e.g., a check mark), or redirection to a success page.
   - **Error Handling**: Clearly display error messages near the relevant form fields to guide users in correcting mistakes.

### 2. **Navigation and Accessibility**
   - **Tab Navigation**: Support tab navigation in web apps to allow users to move logically from one form element to another using the keyboard.
   - **Accessible Menus**: Menus and navigation bars should be easily accessible, with items that are large enough to tap and spaced to prevent accidental taps.

### 3. **Predictive Inputs and Search Functionality**
   - **Auto-Complete**: Implement auto-complete for fields where users input predictable data sets, such as typing in addresses or names of states.
   - **Smart Search**: When users begin typing in search fields, dynamically suggest relevant results or previously searched terms.

### 4. **Responsive and Adaptive Design**
   - **Screen Size Adaptation**: Ensure that layouts adapt gracefully across different devices, maintaining usability and aesthetics from large tablets to small phones.
   - **Orientation Handling**: Optimize app interfaces to respond to changes in device orientation (portrait to landscape and vice versa).

### 5. **Interactive Elements**
   - **Button and Link Feedback**: Provide visual feedback when buttons or links are pressed (e.g., change color, animate slightly) to indicate that the action has been initiated.
   - **Swipe Gestures**: Support common gestures such as swiping to navigate through images or to delete items from a list.

### 6. **Data Saving and Retrieval**
   - **Automatic Saving**: Automatically save user progress or form entries intermittently to prevent data loss in case of an app closure or crash.
   - **Easy Data Retrieval**: Allow users to easily retrieve past entries or data through user profiles or saved records.

### 7. **Multimedia Handling**
   - **Media Controls**: Provide intuitive controls for multimedia elements, such as play, pause, stop, volume, and fullscreen for video and audio playback.
   - **Loading Indicators**: Display loading animations or progress bars when loading content or executing long-running tasks.

### 8. **Notifications and Alerts**
   - **Timely Notifications**: Send notifications for relevant events, such as new messages or updates, ensuring that users are not overwhelmed by frequent or irrelevant notifications.
   - **Actionable Alerts**: Ensure that alerts not only notify the user of an issue or update but also provide an easy way to act on them (e.g., buttons to retry a failed action, dismiss an alert, or view a message).

### 9. **Security and Privacy**
   - **Secure Data Handling**: Encrypt sensitive data such as passwords and personal information both in transit and at rest.
   - **Clear Privacy Policies**: Provide users with clear information on how their data will be used and stored, ensuring compliance with relevant privacy laws.

### 10. **User Onboarding**
   - **Guided Tours**: Offer optional guided tours for first-time users to familiarize them with the app's features and interface.
   - **Help and Support**: Provide easily accessible help and support options, including FAQs, live chat, and customer support contact details.



## Griffin Examples:

- US States dropdown list. I hit the letter 'T' I see 'Tennessee' highlighted. I hit the letter 'E' (or down arrow) I highlight 'Texas'
- I hit the tab key in a form. It takes me to the next form element. 
- I submit a form, I get confirmation, and sent to the next place or best place I need to be.
- Navigation should never leave you stuck without a way to go back, or just go somewhere else.
- Top left logo on an app, should always link to the home / splash page. 
- ETC.
